*My curated list of Computer Science learning resources.*
[ Note (after writing more than half of the layout): I probably should've just used latex to avoid the numbering. :'( ]

#### 3.1.2 Learning Materials
##### Free:
1. tbd: tbd
##### Paid:
1. tbd: tbd
### 3.2 - C++ (incl. STL, Boost, etc.)
#### 3.2.1 Interview Resources
1. tbd: tbd
#### 3.2.2 Learning Materials
##### Free:
1. [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/): Almost like C++ documentation. 
***{I recommend.}***

2. [The C++ Annotations (rug.nl)](http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/): Not for beginners, but a good resource for those who know a few things about programming (in a C-like language). [Some topics included are: STL (Standard Template Library), Multi-threading, etc.] 
***{I recommend.}***

3. [Boost C++ Libraries - Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/): Documentation for the nifty collection of libraries called "Boost". This probably isn't something you should learn, but instead keep it in mind and then use the relevant parts as needed whenever (and if ever) you end up needing to use one of the libraries included in Boost. The number and topics of the libraries are truly vast (from multi-threading to arbitrary precision arithmetic and so on).
***{I recommend.}***

4. [The Cherno (YouTube)](https://youtube.com/@TheCherno): One of the best C++ teachers. I have learned the most nifty tricks from there. (Includes related topics such "Dear ImGUI", GameDev, Game Engine Dev, and general CS concepts).
***{I recommend.}***
