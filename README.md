## 1 - General Resources
### 1.1 - Practice\Exercise Resources
1. [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) - 
"A great site for learning any of 59 different programming languages, all for free. Some languages have more, longer and better tutorials than other languages, but at least the main languages are pretty filled. The learning is challenge-focused, which each lesson being a certain topic (e.g. "Tuples" or "Expression Bodied Members", and then you have to write functioning code using it to pass to more advanced lessons." - From a Reddit thread 
"Exercism is great, I recommend it for new starts at my company for learning golang." - Also from a Reddit Thread

***{I recommend.}***

2. [The C++ Annotations (rug.nl)](http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/): Not for beginners, but a good resource for those who know a few things about programming (in a C-like language). [Some topics included are: STL (Standard Template Library), Multi-threading, etc.] 
***{I recommend.}***

3. [Boost C++ Libraries - Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/): Documentation for the nifty collection of libraries called "Boost". This probably isn't something you should learn, but instead keep it in mind and then use the relevant parts as needed whenever (and if ever) you end up needing to use one of the libraries included in Boost. The number and topics of the libraries are truly vast (from multi-threading to arbitrary precision arithmetic and so on).
***{I recommend.}***
